<h2>AcrossReader</h2>
<p>AcrossReader reads htm-files that are generated by the CAT tool Across for translating document. The code reads the htm file that can be exportet from Across
and converts it into a docx file displaying the translation in a table. Tags inside the source text and translation are removed or replaced. Every entry contains of
the segment id, the source text and the corresponding translation. 100% Fuzzy matches (duplicates) are removed, only the first occurrence is displayed and
stored in the docx file.</p>
